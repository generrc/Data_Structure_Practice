Project for Master's Data Structures that I made harder for myself by writing it entirely in C, to practice memory management.
Takes in graphs and uses Djikstra's, Prim's, and 

To compile the program, type "make"

To run the program, type "make run"


(if this doesn't work cause of lack of packages do the following)
gcc -o main main.c
./main graph1.txt graph2.txt graph3.txt graph4.txt
